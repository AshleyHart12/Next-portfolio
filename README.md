# My Personal Site

Welcome to my personal site repository! This project is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for React applications.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improves performance and SEO by rendering pages on the server.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generates static HTML pages at build time, enhancing speed and scalability.
- **API Routes**: Built-in API support to create API endpoints without the need for an external server.
